This application was written for the demo for my talk for [What Do You Know night](http://whatdoyouknow.webdirections.org/brisbane).

The application shows how `AppCache manifest` and `localStorage` can be used to make a web application available in offline mode. 

###WARNING
This code is written to be demoed over 5 minutes. So I had to cut down on every possible bit of noise and keep the code to its simplest form. Feel free to check the code out as a **sample** for how offline web apps should be done; but don't it as is - A LOT must be improved on this.
