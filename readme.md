This is the sample application for my [Offline Web Applications](http://www.mehdi-khalili.com/presentations/wdyk-offline-web) which was also demoed on my talk for [What Do You Know night](http://whatdoyouknow.webdirections.org/brisbane).

The application shows how `AppCache manifest` and `localStorage` can be used to make a web application available in offline mode.
